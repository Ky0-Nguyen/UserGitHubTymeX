 # UserGitHubTymeX Documentation
 
 ## Overview
 UserGitHubTymeX is an iOS application that allows users to browse and view details of GitHub users. The app fetches data from the GitHub API, displays a list of users, and provides detailed information about each user.
 
 ## Key Components
 
 ### Models
 - `User`: Represents basic information about a GitHub user.
 - `UserDetail`: Contains detailed information about a specific GitHub user.
 
 ### Views
 - `UserListView`: Displays a scrollable list of GitHub users.
 - `UserDetailView`: Shows detailed information about a selected user.
 - `UserRow`: A reusable component for displaying user information in a row.
 
 ### View Models
 - `UserViewModel`: Manages the data and business logic for user-related operations.
 
 ### Services
 - `UserService`: Handles API requests to fetch user data from GitHub.
 - `BaseAPI`: A base class for making network requests to the GitHub API.
 
 ### Utilities
 - `CacheManager`: Manages in-memory caching of user data for improved performance.
 
 ## Key Features
 1. Fetching and displaying a list of GitHub users
 2. Infinite scrolling to load more users
 3. Viewing detailed information about a specific user
 4. Caching of user data for offline access and improved performance
 
 ## Data Flow
 1. `UserListView` requests data from `UserViewModel`
 2. `UserViewModel` checks the cache (via `CacheManager`) for existing data
 3. If data is not cached, `UserViewModel` requests data from `UserService`
 4. `UserService` uses `BaseAPI` to make network requests to the GitHub API
 5. Received data is cached using `CacheManager` and updated in the UI
 
 ## Caching Strategy
 - User list data is cached to reduce API calls and improve load times
 - Individual user details are cached separately for quick access
 - Cache is checked before making network requests to minimize data usage
 
 ## Future Improvements
 - Implement error handling and retry mechanisms for failed API requests
 - Add user authentication to access private GitHub data
 - Implement a search feature to find specific GitHub users
 - Add unit and UI tests for improved code reliability
 
 ## Notes for Developers
 - Ensure all models conform to `Codable` protocol for easy JSON encoding/decoding
 - Use `@ObservedObject` for views that need to react to `UserViewModel` changes
 - When adding new API endpoints, extend the `UserService` class
 - For any new cacheable data, utilize the `CacheManager` class
